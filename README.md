# CashMachineEmulator
A project from JavaRush imitating the work of a cash machine
The cash machine can identify credit users by their credit card numbers and pins (see Login Command class), deposit and withdraw bills of different currencies, provide info on possible errors.
The program involves Command pattern, Greedy algorithm, lots of exception handling, and working with ResourceBundle class.
